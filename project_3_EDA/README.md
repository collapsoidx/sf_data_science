# PROJECT-3. EDA + Feature Engineering.

### **Description of the project**
Creating a first model based on machine learning algorithms;
Taking part in a competition on Kaggle;
Understand how to properly “prepare” the data so that a model performs better.

### **What case are we solving?**
Imagine that you are a data scientist at Booking. One of the problems of the company is dishonest hotels that wind up their rating. One way to find such hotels is to build a model that predicts the rating of the hotel. If the predictions of the model are very different from the actual result, then the hotel may be playing unfairly and should be checked.

You are tasked with creating such a model. Ready to get started?

### **Competition conditions:**
This competition is unlimited and available for all streams.

The deadline for completing the competition is set individually in each stream.

The test sample is presented in the LeaderBoard in its entirety.

We make a real ML product, which can then work normally on new data.

### **Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the MAPE metric.

### **What we practice**
Code quality (compliance with PEP-8 formatting standards, code commenting, README to the project). Project registration on GitHub, GitLab, Kaggle.
Data cleaning.
Data research (quality of visualization, availability of ideas, hypotheses, comments).
Feature generation.
Feature selection.
Feature transformation.

### **Brief information about the data**
This dataset contains information about 515,000 hotel reviews in Europe.
The initial version of the dataset contains 17 fields.

### **Competition Files**
hotels_train.csv - training dataset
hotels_test.csv - data set for quality assessment
submission.csv - submission file in the required format

### **Stages of work on the project**

The task can be presented to five points:

Removing string values. You need to remove columns from the dataset that contain data other than numbers.
Clearing missing values. In the previous step, we did it in the most rough way possible, now try to approach the process more flexibly.
Creation of new signs. We will try to create new columns with data from existing data or using external sources.
Feature transformation. Let's apply various transformations on features like normalization, standardization.
Feature selection. We use multicollinearity analysis as a feature selection step for the model.

### Results:
Score: 13.13242
First place: 11.51996
Random Submission: 43.53361


### Conclusions:
I have created my first machine learning case: I cleaned a rather heavily polluted dataset myself, extracted several new features from it, and prepared data for model training. You also took part in a machine learning competition and joined the world's largest community of active data scientists
