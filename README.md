# Future Data Scientist
Throughout my career with a degree in engineering I have assembled a diverse professional experience with wide skill-set in brand management, marketing, sales and customer interactions.

I have a strong passion for technology and science. At this moment, I'm learning Python and Data Science, as I am fully committed to personal development and growth.

Originally from Ukraine, it will be my pleasure to work in a multicultural environment as I fluently speak Ukrainian, Russian, English , Italian and daily improving my German.
